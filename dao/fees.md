# Tokenomics & Fees

## ACS Tokenomics

$ACS emissions was initially supply capped at 1,888,888 tokens. Tokenomics was upgraded in July 2023 to cut off all emissions. Current total supply can be tracked on [Coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/acryptos/). 

Fees collected from all ACryptoS vaults go to ACryptoS [Treasury](https://debank.com/profile/0x5bd97307a40dfbfdbaef4b3d997adb816f2dadcc) with periodical Buyback and Burning of the ACS token. Adding to the fact that there are no longer any ACS emissions, this results in a deflationary model for the $ACS token, benefiting ACS holders in the long term.

There is no $ACS vault staking. Users only need to hold the token in their wallet to receive the benefits from Buyback and Burn.

For users looking to pair $ACS into a liquidity pool for swap fees or farming, existing pools can be found [here](../acs.md).

*All parameters may be adjusted in future via governance.
