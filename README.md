# Overview

## Introduction

ACryptoS offers two solution platforms on Binance Smart Chain.

1.	Yield Farming Optimizer: ACryptoS Vaults 

2.	Stablecoin DEX: ACryptoS StableSwap


At the same time,we understand the importance of tokenomics.
Our tokenomics and fees are designed to 

1.	Encourage longer term staking 

2.	Reward long term holders of our ACS and ACSI native tokens


## ACryptoS Vaults (Yield Farming Optimizer)


ACryptoS Vaults grow your assets (tokens) via automated Yield Farming Strategies. 

The Vaults achieved highest possible yields through 

1.  Unparalleled creative automations

2.  Optimal compounding frequency

3.  Highly efficient gas utilisation

When you deposit into a vault, your tokens will grow at the fastest optimized yield. 
Let ACrpytoS do the heavy lifting of farming the best possible yield for you.

## ACryptoS StableSwap (Stablecoin DEX)

ACryptoS StableSwap is an [automated market maker \(AMM\)](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-an-automated-market-maker-amm) enabling fast and efficient stablecoin trading.

AcryptoS StableSwap platform allows stablecoin trading at the best prices with low slippage and fees on Binance Smart Chain (BSC).

## ACryptoS Farms
ACS and ACSI native tokens are [distributed via ACryptoS Farms](fees.md#tokenomics).
This incentivise liquidity providers and share a stake in the protocol with our users.

- You will need to stake your tokens in the Vaults to farm the native tokens. (ACS/ACSI)

- Farms need to be manually harvested.

## ACS and ACSI Native Tokens

ACS is our native token of our yield farming optimizer.

ACS staked in the [**ACS Vault**](https://app.acryptos.com/core/):

- accrue protocol [fees and rewards](fees.md#acs-vault) from Vaults and ACS Farms

- and participate in governance of the protocol.

ACSI is the native token of **StableSwap** and probably all future non-vault products. 

ACSI staked in the [**ACSI Vault**](https://app.acryptos.com/acsi/):

- accrue protocol [fees and rewards](fees.md#acs-vault) from [StableSwap and ACSI Farms](https://app.acryptos.com/acsi/)

- and participate in governance of the protocol.


## Tokenomics and Fees

Our tokenomics and fees are designed to encourage 

1. Longer term staking

2. Reward long term holders of our ACS and ACSI native tokens rewards and fees. 

This means if you enter and exit quickly as a liquidity provider, you will likely earn 0 or even a slightly negative return.

Please carefully review our documentation on [fees](fees.md) before proceeding.
