# Overview

## Introduction to Advanced Yield Farming Strategies with ACryptoS 

ACryptoS offers three products on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC).

1.	ACryptoS Vaults (Yield Farming Optimizer)

2.	ACryptoS StableSwap (Stablecoin Decentralized Exchange ([DEX](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-a-decentralized-exchange-dex)) )

3.	Acryptos Farms (where native tokens of ACryptoS, namely ACS and ACSI are farmed)




## 1. ACryptoS Vaults (Yield Farming Optimizer)

ACryptoS Vaults grow your assets (tokens) via automated Yield Strategies. 

The Vaults achieve highest possible yields through: 

1.  Unparalleled creative automations

2.  Optimal compounding frequency

3.  Highly efficient gas utilisation

When you deposit into a Vault, your tokens will grow over time at the fastest optimized yield automactically.

There is no need to manually harvest the Vault.


## 2. ACryptoS StableSwap (Stablecoin DEX)

ACryptoS StableSwap is an [automated market maker \(AMM\)](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-an-automated-market-maker-amm) protocol based
on Curveâ€™s specialized algorithm tailored for stable coins. ACryptoS is offering the first AMM for stable coins based on this algorithm on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC).

Trading on the Binance Smart Chain is both faster and significantly cheaper than trading on the Ethereum chain. ERC-20 Tokens can be crossed over from Ethereum to Binance Smart Chain via the Binance Bridge.

Acryptos StableSwap enables efficient stablecoin trading at best prices which is

- **~10x cheaper**;

- **~100x less slippage** when trading stable coins compared to the various UniSwap type AMMs available.


## 3. ACryptoS Farms
ACryptoS Farms are the places where native tokens of ACryptoS,[ACS and ACSI tokens are distributed](fees.md#tokenomics).

Once assets are deposited into a Vault or StableSwap product, users have the option to **stake** the vault or liquidity tokens they receive back respectively into the corresponding farm.

ACryptoS Vault tokens will yield ACS, and ACryptoS StableSwap Liquidity Provider tokens will yield ACSI as reward in their respective farms.

Things to note:
- You will need to **stake** your tokens in the Vaults to farm the native tokens. (ACS/ACSI)

- Farms **do not** automatically compound and require **manual harvesting** by the user.

- [Auto-compounding Vaults](https://app.acryptos.com/core/) for already harvested or purchased ACS and ACSI tokens are offered on the platform as well.


## ACS and ACSI Native Tokens

1. ACS is our native token of our yield farming optimizer.
   
   
   ACS staked in the [**ACS Vault**](https://app.acryptos.com/core/):

     - accrue protocol [fees and rewards](fees.md#acs-vault) from Vaults and ACS Farms

     - and participate in governance of the protocol.



2. ACSI is the native token of **StableSwap** and probably all future non-vault products. 
   
   
   ACSI staked in the [**ACSI Vault**](https://app.acryptos.com/core/):
  
    - accrue protocol [fees and rewards](fees.md#acs-vault) from [StableSwap and ACSI Farms](https://app.acryptos.com/acsi/)

    - and participate in governance of the protocol.


## Tokenomics and Fees

Our tokenomics and fees are designed to encourage 

1. Longer term staking

2. Reward long term holders of our ACS and ACSI native tokens rewards and fees. 

This means if you enter and exit quickly as a liquidity provider, you will likely earn 0 or even a slightly negative return.

Please carefully review our documentation on [fees](fees.md) before proceeding.
