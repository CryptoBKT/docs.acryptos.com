# Overview

## Introduction

ACryptoS offers 2 products on Binance Smart Chain, yield optimizer ACryptoS Vaults and stablecoin DEX ACryptoS StableSwap. Our tokenomics and fees are designed to encourage longer term staking, and reward long term holders of our ACS and ACSI native tokens.

## ACryptoS Vaults

ACryptoS Vaults grow your assets via automated yield Strategies. This saves users time and enables higher yields through more frequent compounding, more efficient gas utilisation, and other creative automations.

When you deposit into a vault, your tokens will grow over time. You do not need to manually harvest the vaults.

## ACryptoS StableSwap

ACryptoS StableSwap is an automated market maker \(AMM\) enabling fast and efficient stablecoin trading at the best prices with low slippage and fees on Binance Smart Chain.

## ACryptoS Farms

ACS and ACSI are [distributed via ACryptoS Farms](fees.md#tokenomics) to incentivise liquidity providers and share a stake in the protocol with our users.

Farms need to be manually harvested.

## ACS and ACSI Native Tokens

ACS is our native token. ACS staked in the ACS Vault accrue protocol [fees and rewards](fees.md#acs-vault) from Vaults and ACS Farms, and in the future will participate in governance of the protocol.

ACSI is the native token of StableSwap and probably all future non-vault products. ACSI staked in the ACSI Vault accrue protocol [fees and rewards](fees.md#acs-vault) from StableSwap and ACSI Farms, and in the future may participate in governance of the protocol.

## Tokenomics and Fees

Our tokenomics and fees are designed to encourage longer term staking, and reward long term holders of our ACS and ACSI native tokens rewards and fees. This means if you enter and exit quickly as a liquidity provider, you will likely earn 0 or even a slightly negative return. Please carefully review our documentation on [fees](fees.md) before proceeding.
