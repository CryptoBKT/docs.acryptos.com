### ACS and ACSI Governance Vaults

Staking in the Governance Vaults earns you a share of all protocol fees. The ACS Vault earns withdrawal and performance fees from our Vaults, and the ACSI Vault earns exchange fees from our StableSwap. They also earn their respective Farm harvest fees, and token emissions rewards \(33.33% of Farm emissions\). 

Only ACS and ACSI staked in the Governance Vaults can participate in Governance.

Staking in the Governance Vaults represents a commitment to the protocol, and instead of a time lock, there is a significant withdrawal fee.
