# ACryptoS Vaults

ACryptoS Vaults save users time and enables higher yields through through creative automations, optimal compounding frequency, and highly efficient gas utilisation.

When you deposit into a Vault, your tokens will grow over time. You do not need to manually harvest the vaults.

Most Vaults have a Farm where you can **Stake** your deposit to earn ACS or ACSI, a stake in the protocol.

*The only exceptions being the ACS/ ACSI Vaults.

Our Vaults may offer up to three different types of returns depending on the Vault and what the user chooses to do which we have labelled as: 

- Swap APY

- Vault APY

- ACS APR

**Swap APY** represents the rate at which the monetary value of the deposited LP tokens rises at. 
This yield is generated through the swap fees gained as a liquidity provider. 

**Vault APY** refers to the yield generated from Vault Strategies.

**ACS APR** is the rate at which ACS rewards are given to users that stake their tokens.

## ACS and ACSI Vaults

These are the vaults for our native/governance tokens, which receive a [good share of the ongoing token emissions, and most of the protocol fees are used to buy ACS/ACSI to distribute ](fees.md)in these Vaults.

## Venus Vaults 

These Vaults stake recursively on Venus at ~3.67X leverage, farms XVS and swaps it for more of the staked token.

Users may notice the value of their holdings in the Vault **slowly decreasing on each block**.
This is normal as the balance of the Vault is calculated as total supplied less total borrowed, and the borrow APY is higher. 
The XVS earned is not included. 

The balance will increase after each harvest.

## CAKE Vault

This Vault stakes and farms CAKE on PancakeSwap.

## PancakeSwap Liquidity Provider (LP) Vaults

These Vaults stake PancakeSwap LP tokens, farms CAKE and swaps it for more of the staked LP tokens.

## SwipeSwap Liquidity Provider (LP) Vaults

These Vaults stake SwipeSwap LP tokens, farms SXP and swaps it for more of the staked LP tokens.


## Workers

Anyone can help [harvest an ACryptoS Vault](https://app.acryptos.com/worker/) and earn the [harvester's reward](fees.md#all-vaults) as a gas subsidy. This decentralises the automation of our vaults. 

You do not need to do this as a normal user, your holdings in the vault will compound automatically.
