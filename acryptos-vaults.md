# ACryptoS Vaults

ACryptoS Vaults save users time and enables higher yields through more frequent compounding, more efficient gas utilisation, and other creative automations.

When you deposit into a vault, your tokens will grow over time. You do not need to manually harvest the vaults.

Most Vaults have a Farm where you can Stake your deposit to earn ACS or ACSI, a stake in the protocol.

## ACS and ACSI Vaults

These are the vaults for our native/governance tokens, which receive a [good share of the ongoing token emissions, and most of the protocol fees are used to buy ACS/ACSI to distribute ](fees.md)in these vaults.

## Venus Vaults \(BNB, SXP, XVS, BUSD, USDT, USDC\)

These vaults stake recursively on Venus at ~3.67X leverage, farms XVS and swaps it for more of the staked token.

Users may notice the value of their holdings in the vault slowly decreasing on each block, this is normal as the balance of the Vault is calculated as total supplied less total borrowed, and the borrow APY is higher. The XVS earned is not included. The balance will increase after each harvest.

## CAKE Vault

This vault stakes and farms CAKE on PancakeSwap.

## PancakeSwap LP Vaults \(BTC-BNB, ETH-BNB, etc\)

These vaults stake PancakeSwap LP tokens, farms CAKE and swaps it for more of the staked LP tokens.

## Workers

Anyone can help [harvest an ACryptoS Vault](https://app.acryptos.com/worker/) and earn the [harvester's reward](fees.md#all-vaults) as a gas subsidy. This decentralises the automation of our vaults. You do not need to do this as a normal user, your holdings in the vault will compound automatically.
