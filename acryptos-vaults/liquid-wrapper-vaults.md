# Liquid Wrapper Vaults

Our Liquid Wrapper Vaults are a set of vaults specially designed to work with ve(3,3) DEXs, allowing liquidity for otherwise locked native tokens, and providing Boosted yields for users. These vaults work cohesively together to form a positive flywheel.

### Benefits:
- helping ve(3,3) protocols lock more of their native tokens to veNFTs
- allowing users to farm higher APY with their tokens without the need to invest in native token veNFTs

## How It Works

_*Our Liquid Wrapper Vault mechanics vary depending on different partners. Check individual docs in the next few pages for full details._

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Liquid veNFT Vault (acs_veNFT)
- Users stake their ve(3,3) DEX native tokens in the vault, getting a acs_veNFT receipt token, and get benefits as if they locked veNFT themselves (trading fees/bribes/rebases etc.). Our strategy then locks the tokens for max period, getting max veNFT voting power.
- 50% of Boosted rewards from ALL our LP Vaults on the ve(3,3) DEX, are rewarded to acs.veNFT (veNFT Vault) holders
- This veNFT Vault maintains a % Reserve, allowing users to withdraw back the DEX native tokens at any time, where otherwise their veNFT would be locked for 4 years

_*Note: Withdrawals are subject to available DEX native tokens in the Vault Reserves. Reserves are constantly topped up from multiple sources (bribes/Boost Rewards etc.). Vault Strategy is based on our Liquidizer Vault (one of our other unique strategies, more info [here](../acryptos-vaults/liquidizer-vaults.md))_

TL/DR üëâ Users stake their $SLIZ, gets full locking benefits without locking, gets rewards APY from all our LP Vaults on SolidLizard

The more $SLIZ staked in the veSLIZ Vault, the higher the Boosted APY for the LP vaults‚Ü©Ô∏è

The more the LP vaults gain TVL, the more rewards go to the veSLIZ Vault‚Ü©Ô∏è

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ autoCompunding vaults for Liquidity Pool farms
- These vaults collect $SLIZ emissions from the farm, and autoCompound them back into the LP, increasing the number of tokens in the LP
- The veNFT in the Liquid veSLIZ Vault (explained [below](../acryptos-vaults/liquid-wrapper-vaults#2-liquid-vesliz-vault-acssliz)) will Boost the APY for these vaults, up to 2.5X

Examples:
- User A forms a ETH-ARB LP, and farms it for 50% APR, manually harvesting the $SLIZ rewards every few days. User A has no Boosted rewards because he doesn't lock $SLIZ for any veSLIZ
- User B forms a ETH-ARB LP, and stakes in our ETH-ARB Vault. The $SLIZ rewards are autoCompounded few times a day, swapping $SLIZ to ETH and ARB, forming more ETH-ARB LP, and adding on to the original stake. User B gets 125% APR (2.5X Boosted rewards) even if he doesn't lock $SLIZ for veSLIZ.

TL/DR üëâUsers can autoCompound their LP with Boosted rewards, without needing to lock $SLIZ to veSLIZ themselves.



### 3Ô∏è‚É£ acsSLIZ-SLIZ LP vault
- Users can pair their acsSLIZ token (Liquid veSLIZ Vault receipt) with $SLIZ, forming an LP
- The voting power from the single-token veSLIZ Vault will be directed to the acsSLIZ-SLIZ LP farm
_*voting strategy might be adjusted after initial launch period, based on TVL and APY_
- Based on the weekly voting %, the farm receives $SLIZ emissions.
- Users can form the LP and stake in our acsSLIZ-SLIZ Vault, autoCompounding more of acsSLIZ-SLIZ
- This acsSLIZ-SLIZ LP provides another method for users to exit their acsSLIZ position back to $SLIZ

TL/DR üëâ Users get max APY by staking in Liquid veSLIZ Vault, then using the receipt acsSLIZ token to stake further in acsSLIZ-SLIZ Vault
