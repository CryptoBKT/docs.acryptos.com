# SolidLizard Liquid Wrapper Vault (acsSLIZ)

## How It Works

[SolidLizard](https://solidlizard.finance/) $SLIZ

- They have a 2.5X [Boost function](https://solidlizard.gitbook.io/solidlizard/how-to-use-the-boost-calculator) for their LP farms. If a user stakes $SLIZ as a veNFT, locking it for a period of time, they will receive Boosts on the LP farms they stake in.

- The larger the veNFT they have, the more they will be able to Boost the LP farms.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ autoCompunding vaults for Liquidity Pool farms
- These vaults collect $SLIZ emissions from the farm, and autoCompound them back into the LP, increasing the number of tokens in the LP
- The veNFT in the Liquid veSLIZ Vault (explained [below](../acryptos-vaults/liquid-wrapper-vaults#2-liquid-vesliz-vault-acssliz)) will Boost the APY for these vaults, up to 2.5X

Examples:
- User A forms a ETH-ARB LP, and farms it for 50% APR, manually harvesting the $SLIZ rewards every few days. User A has no Boosted rewards because he doesn't lock $SLIZ for any veSLIZ
- User B forms a ETH-ARB LP, and stakes in our ETH-ARB Vault. The $SLIZ rewards are autoCompounded few times a day, swapping $SLIZ to ETH and ARB, forming more ETH-ARB LP, and adding on to the original stake. User B gets 125% APR (2.5X Boosted rewards) even if he doesn't lock $SLIZ for veSLIZ.

TL/DR üëâUsers can autoCompound their LP with Boosted rewards, without needing to lock $SLIZ to veSLIZ themselves.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Liquid veSLIZ Vault (acsSLIZ)
- Users stake their $SLIZ in the vault, getting a acsSLIZ receipt token, and get benefits as if they locked veSLIZ themselves (trading fees/bribes/rebases etc.). Our strategy then locks the $SLIZ for max period, getting max veSLIZ voting power.
- 50% of Boosted rewards from ALL our LP Vaults, are rewarded to acsSLIZ (veSLIZ Vault) holders
- This veSLIZ Vault allows users to withdraw $SLIZ at any time, where otherwise their veSLIZ would be locked for 4 years

_*Note: Withdrawals are subject to available $SLIZ in the Vault Reserves. Reserves are constanly topped up from above-mentioned sources (bribes/Boost Rewards etc.). Vault Strategy is based on our Liquidizer Vault (one of our other unique strategies, more info [here](../acryptos-vaults/liquidizer-vaults.md))_

TL/DR üëâ Users stake their $SLIZ, gets full locking benefits without locking, gets rewards APY from all our LP Vaults on SolidLizard

The more $SLIZ staked in the veSLIZ Vault, the higher the Boosted APY for the LP vaults‚Ü©Ô∏è

The more the LP vaults gain TVL, the more rewards go to the veSLIZ Vault‚Ü©Ô∏è

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ acsSLIZ-SLIZ LP vault
- Users can pair their acsSLIZ token (Liquid veSLIZ Vault receipt) with $SLIZ, forming an LP
- The voting power from the single-token veSLIZ Vault will be directed to the acsSLIZ-SLIZ LP farm
_*voting strategy might be adjusted after initial launch period, based on TVL and APY_
- Based on the weekly voting %, the farm receives $SLIZ emissions.
- Users can form the LP and stake in our acsSLIZ-SLIZ Vault, autoCompounding more of acsSLIZ-SLIZ
- This acsSLIZ-SLIZ LP provides another method for users to exit their acsSLIZ position back to $SLIZ

TL/DR üëâ Users get max APY by staking in Liquid veSLIZ Vault, then using the receipt acsSLIZ token to stake further in acsSLIZ-SLIZ Vault
