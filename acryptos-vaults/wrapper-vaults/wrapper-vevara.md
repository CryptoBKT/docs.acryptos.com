### 1Ô∏è‚É£ autoCompunding vaults for Liquidity Pool farms
- These vaults collect $VARA emissions from the farm, and autoCompound them back into the LP, increasing the number of tokens in the LP
- Performance fees collected from the yields are one of the lowest (almost half of other major yield optimizers), and already factored into the APY, displayed accurately real-time.

TL/DR üëâUsers can autoCompound their LP with Boosted rewards, with one of the lowest fees among Yield Optimizers.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Liquid veVARA Vault (acsVARA)
- Users stake their $VARA in the vault, getting a acsVARA receipt token, and get benefits as if they locked veVARA themselves (trading fees/bribes/rebases etc.). Our strategy then locks the $VARA for max period, getting max veVARA voting power.
- This veVARA Vault receipt token can be then paired with VARA, allowing users to swap $acsVARA to $VARA at any time, where otherwise their veVARA would be locked for 4 years

TL/DR üëâ Users stake their $VARA, gets full locking benefits, while being able to swap back to $VARA.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ acsVARA-VARA autoCompounding vault
- Users can pair their acsVARA token (Liquid veVARA Vault receipt) with $VARA, forming an LP
- The voting power from the single-token veVARA Vault will be directed to the acsVARA-VARA LP farm
_*voting strategy might be adjusted after initial launch period, based on TVL and APY_
- Based on the weekly voting %, the farm receives $VARA emissions.
- Users can form the LP and stake in our acsVARA-VARA Vault, autoCompounding more of acsVARA-VARA
- This acsVARA-VARA LP is currently the main liquidity for users looking to exit their acsVARA position back to $VARA

TL/DR üëâ Users get a good APY by staking in Liquid veVARA Vault, then using the receipt acsVARA token to stake further in acsVARA-VARA Vault, gaining even more APY.
