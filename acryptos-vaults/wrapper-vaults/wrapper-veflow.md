# Velocimeter Liquid Wrapper Vault (acsFLOW)

## How It Works

[Velocimeter DEX](https://www.velocimeter.xyz/) $FLOW

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ autoCompunding vaults for Liquidity Pool farms
- These vaults collect $FLOW emissions from the farm, and autoCompound them back into the LP, increasing the number of tokens in the LP
- Performance fees collected from the yields are one of the lowest (almost half of other major yield optimizers), and already factored into the APY, displayed accurately real-time.

TL/DR üëâUsers can autoCompound their LP with Boosted rewards, with one of the lowest fees among Yield Optimizers.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Liquid veFLOW Vault (acsFLOW)
- Users stake their $FLOW in the vault, getting a acsFLOW receipt token, and get benefits as if they locked veFLOW themselves (trading fees/bribes/rebases etc.). Our strategy then locks the $FLOW for max period, getting max veFLOW voting power.
- This veFLOW Vault receipt token can be then paired with FLOW, allowing users to swap $acsFLOW to $FLOW at any time, where otherwise their veFLOW would be locked for 4 years

_*Note: Withdrawals are subject to available $FLOW in the Vault Reserves. Reserves are constantly topped up from above-mentioned sources (bribes/fees etc.). Vault Strategy is based on our Liquidizer Vault (one of our other unique strategies, more info [here](../acryptos-vaults/liquidizer-vaults.md))_

TL/DR üëâ Users stake their $FLOW, gets full locking benefits without locking

The more $FLOW staked in the veFLOW Vault, the higher the Boosted APY for the LP vaults‚Ü©Ô∏è

The more the LP vaults gain TVL, the more rewards go to the veFLDX Vault‚Ü©Ô∏è

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ acsFLOW-FLOW LP vault
- Users can pair their acsFLOW token (Liquid veFLOW Vault receipt) with $FLOW, forming an LP
- The voting power from the single-token veFLOW Vault will be directed to the acsFLOW-FLOW LP farm
_*voting strategy might be adjusted after initial launch period, based on TVL and APY_
- Based on the weekly voting %, the farm receives $FLOW emissions.
- Users can form the LP and stake in our acsFLOW-FLOW Vault, autoCompounding more of acsFLOW-FLOW
- This acsFLOW-FLOW LP is currently the mainswap for users looking to exit their acsFLOW position back to $FLOW

TL/DR üëâ Users get max APY by staking in Liquid veFLDX Vault, then using the receipt acsFLOW token to stake further in acsFLOW-FLOW Vault
