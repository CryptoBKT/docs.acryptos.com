# ACryptoS StableSwap

## Cheaper Better Faster

Exchange fees are typically ~10X cheaper and slippage ~100X smaller compared to the various UniSwap type AMMs on Binance Smart Chain. This is due to the usage of Curve's [specialized algorithm tailored for trading of stablecoins and other pegged assets](https://www.curve.fi/stableswap-paper.pdf).

Trading on Binance Smart Chain also means gas costs up to ~100X cheaper than on Ethereum, and a ~5X faster block interval of 3 seconds.

## Yield Farming with ACSI <a id="b267"></a>

We share a stake in the protocol with ACryptoS StableSwap liquidity providers, distributing ACSI tokens via our farms. 50% of exchange fees are used to buy back and distribute ACSI to ACSI stakers via the ACSI Vault, while the remainder are earned by liquidity providers.

Do remember to stake in our Farms after depositing into the pools.

## ACS4USD Corepool

Our core pool comprises the 4 staple stablecoins: BUSD, USDT, DAI and USDC.

## ACS4 + VAI / UST / QUSD Metapools

These metapools allow seamless trading between the metapool's additional token, and all 4 tokens in the ACS4USD core-pool.

Metapools allow for one token to seemingly trade with another underlying base pool with several benefits:

* Prevents dilution of base pool.
* Allows listing of less liquid assets.
* Base pool holders are shielded from systemic risks of the metapool. \(i.e. should VAI lose it's peg, ACS4USD corepool liquidity providers who did not provide liquidity to the metapool will not be affected\)
