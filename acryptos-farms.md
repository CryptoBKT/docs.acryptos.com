# ACryptoS Farms

## ACS Farms V2

The SFP-BNB Vault&Farm and LTC Vault&Farm will be the first \(and only\) Vaults on V2 to start on 10 Feb 2021. We plan to migrate all ACS Farms to V2 eventually, this will be announced at a later date with ample notice.

* Staking and un-staking no longer triggers a harvest.
* ACS Vault holdings is used to boost rewards up to 2.5X.

#### ACS Rewards Boost

In V2, ACS Vault holdings are used to boost ACS rewards by up to 2.5X. The amount of boost is determined via the following formula:

1.5 \* \[% user's share of acsACS\] \* \[TVL in Farm\]

Example: User deposits 20 LTC in Vault&Farm, there is 1500 LTC in the farm in total, and user has 1% share of the ACS Vault. His available boost is 1500 \* 1.5 \* 1% = 22.5 LTC, so a share of 20 + 22.5 = 42.5 LTC will be used to calculate his ACS Rewards. If he deposits only 1 LTC, it will be boosted to the maximum 2.5X of 2.5 LTC. If he deposits 100 LTC, it will be boosted to 100 + 22.5 = 122.5 LTC.

User's boost is updated on every stake/un-stake/harvest.
