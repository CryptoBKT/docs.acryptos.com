# ACryptoS Farms

Most Vaults and StableSwap pools will have a corresponding Farm where they can be staked to earn ACS or ACSI. Be sure to stake in the Farm after depositing into a Vault or StableSwap pool.

## ACS Rewards Boost

In ACS Farms, ACS Vault holdings are used to boost ACS rewards by **up to 2.5X**.

The amount of boost is determined via the following formula:

**1.5 \* \[% user's share of acsACS\] \* \[TVL in Farm\]**

Example:

User deposits 20 LTC in Vault&Farm, there is 1500 LTC in the farm in total, and user has 1% share of the ACS Vault.

His available boost is 1.5 \* 1% \* 1500 = 22.5 LTC, so a share of 20 + 22.5 = 42.5

LTC will be used to calculate his ACS Rewards.

If he deposits only 1 LTC, it will be boosted **up to the maximum 2.5X of 2.5 LTC**.

If he deposits 100 LTC, it will be boosted to 100 + 22.5 = 122.5 LTC.

* User's boost is updated on the following event:
  * Stake
  * Un-stake
  * Harvest
* Users boost calculation is for each farm individually.

### **User Interface**

**Current Boost**: The current boost you are getting in the farm from your ACS Vault holdings.  
**Future Boost**: The boost you will get after you stake/un-stake/harvest. Pressing **'Force'** will update this boost manually.  
**For 2.5X**: The amount of vaulted ACS you need to get the maximum boost on your current Farm stake.  
**2.5X On First**: The amount you can stake in the Farm that will get the maximum boost based on your current vaulted ACS.
