# Chronos Finance LP Vaults

Chronos Finance incentivises liquidity providers with "[maturity adjusted](https://docs.chronos.exchange/product-docs/dex-functionality/liquidity-pools#maturity-adjusted-lp-returns)" farming emissions that increase over time.

Our Vaults fully optimise for this:

* On any withdrawal, the newest deposits are withdrawn first. This maximises our maturity adjusted boost.
* Whenever possible, we merge (on deposit) and split (on withdrawal) the Vaults' maNFTs to optimise yield and gas costs.
